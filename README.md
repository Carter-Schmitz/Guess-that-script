Javascript quiz game


A quiz game to test knowledge of basic javascript. Once the start button is pressed a countdown of 75 seconds begins, in which the user answers 5 multiple choice questions. The users final score is based on how much time is remaining when the game finishes. This is achieved primarily by creating an array of objects to contain the questions, and the iterating through them whenever an answer is chosen. The way I chose to do this is by pulling all the values from the current index, then once the user inputs, moving to the next object in the array through a separate function. This was a particularly challenging project, as there were many moving pieces to keep track of. Moving forward I would like to apply more of the methods made available by third party APIs.
